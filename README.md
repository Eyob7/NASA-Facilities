Project Description

For Purpose

The State Energy Data System (SEDS) was developed and is maintained and
operated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The goal in
maintaining SEDS is to create historical time series of energy production,
consumption, prices, and expenditures by state that are defined as consistently
as possible over time and across sectors. SEDS exists for two principal
reasons: (1) to provide state energy production, consumption, price, and
expenditure estimates to Members of Congress, federal and state agencies,
and the general public, and (2) to provide the historical series necessary for
EIA’s energy models.

The report

SEDS provides annual energy price and expenditure estimates for all energy
sources by major economic sectors for the 50 states and the District of
Columbia and in aggregate for the United States. These data are available on
the EIA website at http://www.eia.gov/state/seds/seds-data-complete.php.
Companion tables containing state-level consumption data can also be found
at the same website. In addition, tables showing state-level consumption,
price, and expenditure estimates by energy source as they are updated for
the most current year can be found at http://www.eia.gov/state/seds/sedsdata-complete.php.
Due to page-size constraints, most of the time series tables displayed as
Portable Document Format (PDF) files show estimates for only selected years
from 1970 through 1995; thereafter, estimates are shown consecutively.
However, estimates for all years from 1970 forward are maintained in SEDS
and are included in the HTML versions of the tables and in the CSV data files
available via EIA’s website. All years are covered by the documentation in this
report.

All estimates with revisions since the last edition of SEDS that are large
enough to be seen in the published tables’ level of rounding are preceded with
an “R” in the PDF data tables on the website.

Price Estimates

Price estimates in SEDS are expressed in current dollars per million Btu
(British thermal units) to facilitate comparison across energy sources. There
is no adjustment for general inflation over time.
Sections 2 through 6 of the Technical Notes describe how the price estimates
are developed, including sources of data, methods of estimation, and
conversion factors applied.

Reliable data for state-level prices rarely exist, especially as series that are
consistent over a long period. Estimates and assumptions are applied to
fill data gaps and to maintain consistent definitions in the data series over
time. SEDS incorporates the most consistent series and procedures possible
for these estimates and assumptions. However, users should recognize the
limitations imposed on the system due to changing and inadequate data
sources. Estimates often are based on a variety of surrogate measures that
are selected on the basis of availability, applicability as indicators, continuity
over time, and consistency among the various energy commodities. Original
source documents for data used in SEDS (cited in this documentation) include
descriptions of collection methodologies, universes, imputation or adjustment
techniques (if any), and errors associated with the individual processes. Due
to the numerous collection forms and procedures associated with these
reports, it is not possible to develop a meaningful numerical estimate of the
statistical errors of the material published in the SEDS price and expenditure
tables.

It is also important to note that, even within a state, a single average price may
have limited meaning in that it represents a consumption-weighted average
over a whole state. For example, urban and rural electricity prices can vary
significantly from a state’s weighted average, and prices in one region of a
state may differ from those in another because of access to less expensive
hydroelectricity. Differences within a state may also be greater than
differences among adjacent states. Thus, the principal value of the estimates
in these tables lies in general comparisons among the states, interstate
comparisons for a given year, and the analysis of trends over several years.

Specific Requirements

The visualization will include a Python Flask powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.) and also it will  fall into one of the below four tracks: A custom "creative" D3.js project (i.e. non-standard graph or chart)

A combination of Web Scraping and Leaflet or Plotly, A dashboard page with multiple charts all updating from the same data, A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (will be approved)

This  project work will include at least one JS library that we did not cover, it will be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

and it will include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes, etc.)

Final, visualization will ideally include at least three views
